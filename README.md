# Pok√©mon Battle Simulation - MCP Server

This project is a robust, MCP-compliant server that provides access to comprehensive Pok√©mon data and a powerful battle simulator. It is paired with an intelligent, terminal-based client that uses a dedicated knowledge base and natural language processing to understand and execute your commands.

This implementation fulfills the requirements of the AI Engineer Intern technical assessment, providing both a Pok√©mon data resource and an advanced battle simulation tool.

## üåü Key Features

**üß† Intelligent NLP Client**: Interact with the server using natural language. The client builds a knowledge base of all Pok√©mon to accurately understand your requests.

**üìä Comprehensive Pok√©mon Data**: Get detailed information on any Pok√©mon, including stats, types, abilities, evolution chains, and notable moves.

**‚öîÔ∏è Advanced Battle Simulator**: Simulate battles with accurate turn order, damage calculation (including STAB and critical hits), type effectiveness, and status effects.

**üî¨ Smart Weakness Analysis**: Ask "what is psychic weak to?" and the client will deduce the answer by intelligently orchestrating multiple tool calls in the background.

**üîå MCP Compliant**: The server correctly implements the Model Context Protocol, exposing its capabilities through standardized `resources.*` and `tools.*` methods.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

The system consists of two main components that communicate seamlessly: an intelligent Python client and a powerful Node.js/TypeScript server.

### The Intelligent Client (`terminal_client.py`)

1. On startup, it builds a knowledge base of all Pok√©mon names from the PokeAPI.
2. It uses this knowledge to parse your natural language commands, identifying your intent (e.g., "battle", "info") and the specific Pok√©mon involved.
3. It constructs a formal JSON-RPC request and sends it to the server.

### The MCP Server (`server.ts`)

1. Listens for requests from the client.
2. Based on the request, it calls the appropriate tool (e.g., `battle_simulator`, `get_pokemon`).
3. Performs the necessary actions, like fetching data from the PokeAPI or running a complex battle simulation.
4. Sends a structured JSON-RPC response back to the client.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 18.0.0)
- Python (>= 3.6)
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Pok-mon-Battle-Simulation
```

### Step 2: Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Build the Server

```bash
npm run build
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Start the full experience (server + interactive AI terminal):

```bash
python terminal_client.py
```

## üí° Usage Examples

Interact with natural language:

### Get Pok√©mon Info

```
tell me about dragonite
show me the stats for gengar
```

### Simulate a Battle

```
who would win in a fight, charizard or blastoise?
start a battle between pikachu and lugia
```

### Analyze Type Weaknesses

```
what is the weakness of a psychic type?
is fighting effective against steel?
```
